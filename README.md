Attendance Proof System

This project is a blockchain-based Attendance Proof System deployed on the Edu Chain network. It ensures a secure and transparent way to track student attendance using smart contracts.

📌 Features

Blockchain-Powered: Uses smart contracts to ensure tamper-proof attendance records.

Automated Verification: Students' attendance is recorded based on predefined rules.

Decentralized & Secure: Eliminates fraudulent attendance marking.

Transparency: All attendance records are visible on the blockchain.

Smart Contract Deployment: The system is deployed on the Edu Chain network.

Network: Edu Chain

🚀 How It Works

The teacher or admin initiates an attendance session.

Students authenticate and mark their presence through the system.

The smart contract verifies and stores the attendance record.

Attendance can be viewed transparently on the blockchain.
